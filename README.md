This is an Android Project under my course 'Software Developer'.
It's an Android application that allows a health visitor (with a serial number registered in advance) to insert its package and non-package fee with a voucher in attachment (a photo taken with the cellphone) and creates a database with tables to insert fees.
This application also shows the total fees added during a period requested. It can also send the tables of the embedded database to a remote database.
